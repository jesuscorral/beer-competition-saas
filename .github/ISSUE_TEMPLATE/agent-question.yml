        I'm implementing the offline scoresheet entry feature. I've created the React form component, but I'm unsure about the best approach for handling sync conflicts when the app comes back online.

      placeholder: |
        When syncing offline scoresheets to the backend:
        
        1. Should I use optimistic concurrency (ETag) or last-write-wins?
        2. What should the conflict resolution UI look like from a UX perspective?
        3. Is there an existing pattern in the codebase I should follow?

      label: Options Considered
      description: What solutions have you thought about? Pros/cons of each?
      placeholder: |
        **Option A: Optimistic Concurrency (ETag)**
        - ✅ Pros: Prevents accidental overwrites, proper conflict detection
        - ❌ Cons: More complex to implement, requires ETag support in API
        
        **Option B: Last-Write-Wins**
        - ✅ Pros: Simpler implementation, no conflict UI needed
        - ❌ Cons: Risk of losing scoresheet data
        
        **Option C: Server-Side Timestamp Comparison**
        - ✅ Pros: Backend handles logic, frontend stays simple
        - ❌ Cons: Clock skew issues, time zone complications
        
        **My Recommendation:** Option A, but want to confirm this aligns with project patterns.

        **Timeline:** Need to complete this by end of week for MVP
        
        **Constraints:**
        - Must work offline (judges have no WiFi in tasting rooms)
        - Can't lose scoresheet data (critical for competition integrity)
        - Should handle 50+ judges syncing simultaneously
        
        **References:**
        - BJCP guidelines require paper backup scoresheets
        - Similar pattern in competition entry submission
