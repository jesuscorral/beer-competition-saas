# 🗺️ MVP Implementation Roadmap

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-04  
**Target:** Production-ready MVP in 12-16 weeks  
**Team:** 3-4 engineers (2 backend, 1 frontend, 1 full-stack/devops)  
**Status:** 🟢 Sprint 0 & 1 Partially Complete - Infrastructure & Auth Implemented

---

## 📐 Implementation Strategy

### Core Principles
1. **Foundation First:** Infrastructure and authentication must be rock-solid ✅ **DONE**
2. **Vertical Slices:** Complete user journeys before expanding features
3. **Parallel Workstreams:** Backend and frontend can work in parallel after Sprint 1
4. **Test as You Go:** Integration tests with every feature (Testcontainers) ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
5. **Deploy Early:** Staging environment from Sprint 1, dogfooding from Sprint 2

### Critical Path
The following issues are on the critical path and CANNOT be parallelized:
1. ✅ INFRA-001 → INFRA-002 → INFRA-003 → INFRA-004 **COMPLETED**
2. ✅ AUTH-001 → AUTH-002 → AUTH-003 **COMPLETED**
3. 🔄 COMP-001 → COMP-002 → COMP-003 → COMP-004 **IN PROGRESS** (COMP-001/002 done)
4. ENTRY-001 → ENTRY-002 → ENTRY-003 (Entry workflow)
5. FLIGHT-001 → FLIGHT-002 → SCORE-001 → SCORE-002 (Judging workflow)
6. BOS-001 → BOS-002 → BOS-003 → BOS-004 (BOS workflow)

## 📊 Effort Summary by Sprint

| Sprint | Backend Days | Frontend Days | DevOps Days | Total Days | Status |
|--------|--------------|---------------|-------------|------------|--------|
| Sprint 0 | 14 | 0 | 5 | 19 | ✅ 80% Complete |
| Sprint 1 | 20 | 12 | 0 | 32 | ✅ 60% Complete |
| Sprint 2 | 17 | 13 | 0 | 30 | ⏳ Not Started |
| Sprint 3 | 19 | 8 | 0 | 27 | ⏳ Not Started |
| Sprint 4 | 9 | 18 | 0 | 27 | ⏳ Not Started |
| Sprint 5 | 16 | 4 | 0 | 20 | ⏳ Not Started |
| Sprint 6 | 13 | 5 | 11 | 29 | ⏳ Not Started |
| **Total** | **108** | **60** | **16** | **184 person-days** | |

**Current Progress:**
- ✅ **Completed:** ~28 person-days (15%)
- 🔄 **In Progress:** ~12 person-days (7%)
- ⏳ **Remaining:** ~144 person-days (78%)

**With 3-4 Engineers:**
- **3 engineers:** ~61 working days = 12-13 weeks (realistic with buffer)
- **4 engineers:** ~46 working days = 9-10 weeks (aggressive, assumes perfect parallelization)

**Recommendation:** 12-16 weeks with 3-4 engineers (includes buffer for unknowns, testing, bug fixes)

---

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

### Continuous Deployment
- **Sprint 1+:** Deploy to staging environment weekly
- **Sprint 2+:** Internal dogfooding (team uses app to plan test competition)
- **Sprint 4+:** Beta testing with 1-2 real competitions
- **Sprint 6:** Production launch

### Environments
1. **Development:** Local Docker Compose
2. **Staging:** Azure Container Apps with PostgreSQL Flexible Server
3. **Production:** Azure Container Apps with HA PostgreSQL, Redis cache, multi-region

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Per Sprint
- **Unit Tests:** Required for all handlers, validators (>80% coverage)
- **Integration Tests:** Testcontainers with real PostgreSQL/RabbitMQ
- **Manual Testing:** Each story tested by PM before sprint end

### Sprint 6 (Pre-Launch)
- **E2E Tests:** Cypress tests for critical user journeys
- **Load Testing:** k6 scripts simulating 200+ concurrent users
- **Security:** OWASP ZAP scan, dependency audit
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance check (Axe DevTools)

---

## 🔄 Risk Mitigation

### High Risks
1. **Offline PWA Complexity (SCORE-001):**
   - Risk: Service Workers and IndexedDB sync issues
   - Mitigation: Spike in Sprint 3, prototype offline flow
   - Fallback: Online-only version if PWA blocked

2. **Flight Assignment Algorithm (FLIGHT-001):**
   - Risk: Algorithm doesn't balance flights well
   - Mitigation: Start with simple heuristic, iterate
   - Fallback: Manual flight creation by organizer

3. **Multi-Tenancy Leaks:**
   - Risk: Cross-tenant data access bugs
   - Mitigation: RLS at database level (defense in depth)
   - Testing: Dedicated integration tests for tenant isolation

4. **Scoresheet Sync Conflicts (SCORE-002):**
   - Risk: Complex conflict resolution logic
   - Mitigation: Last-write-wins with timestamps (simple)
   - Monitoring: Log all conflicts for analysis

- **Sprint 3:** FLIGHT-002 blocks scoresheet entry
- **Sprint 4:** SCORE-001 blocks judging workflow

**Mitigation:** Ensure critical path issues are staff-ed with senior engineers
